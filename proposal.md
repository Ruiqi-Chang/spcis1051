# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Global Education for Children (GEC)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This website will show you the top 10 countries around the world that lack providing education for children because of various reasons such as war, poverty, gender inequality, cultural/tradition differences, etc.. The countries will showcase background information, clips, pictures, charity/donation links, and other info to allow the interacting user to contribute if they are interested. [If time allows we would like to add in an interactive game, such as a wordsearch - only if we have time to add this feature onto our website.] 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Majority of the site will be coded and executed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with a probable use of APIs.There may be an interactive map on the site to showcase the countries and allow users to either select the country from the interactive map or there will be an image of the map - made interactable. We will try to connect the Mysql database with our website and use the HTTP POST method to show data on our website. This will allow users to select which country to see by querying data from our Mysql database and show it on the interactive map.We will be using a combination of multiple softwares such as Visual Studio Code and Dreamweaver to publish our website onto the server given by our TA. 


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Minu Patel - tuj89678@temple.edu --- Joanne Nichols 
Ruiqi Chang - tuj90607@temple.edu -- Joanne Nichols 


## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

We want to accomplish an informative interactive website that users would want to return to not only gain more information but to enjoy the functionality the website provides. Our goal is to completely have at least 2-3 videos and multiple pictures to go well with our research and find enough organizations that we can link to donate. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

We can surely get the basics down of the website, homepage, navigation bar, bootstraps, etc. along with the written information that will go with the website. Our most challenging part would be an interactive map that will sit right on the homepage of the website. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Our goal is to not only educate ourselves more on the countries that lack education but in the future use our careers to expand our contributions to educate children across the globe that cannot afford to or live in a village,town or city that lacks basic education needs. We hope to get the majority of our site completed by the time we begin to approach our submission date, and hope that it functions the way we have visioned. With the remaining time we would have we would then like to add in the interactive word search we mentioned earlier in our proposal to make our project even more intractable and interesting.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps will go as follows: 
Finalize the top 10 countries to include in our website and split the research among us. 
~ Minu will get started on the layout and basics of the website including the homepage, navigation bar and CSS of the website using HTML. 
~ Ruiqi will begin to conduct research and gather information on how to put an interactive map into a website that only allows the user to interact with the countries chosen
~ Ruiqi and Minu will then both get on a zoom call to implement the interactive map with the existing code that Minu will have and do some trials on the server given 
! On side, both team members will be collecting as much and many information and data needed for each country 
! Both students will also have a shared checklist that they will refer back to and have set deadlines for to keep the project on track and accomplish all the required parts at least 2-3 days before the final submission incase of errors, last minute changes or any other issues that may arise. 
These are just some of the steps that we have already started on or plan on starting on once the proposal is submitted. Other parts of the project will be planned out through a zoom call that will take place between both team members.
