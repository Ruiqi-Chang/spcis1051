Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We did multiple parts of our HTML, JS files and built a database, but did not finish the original project that we had planned as we discovered that we may need to spend some money on a third-party API to get an interactive map onto our site or learn to use Leaflet.js package which is a totally new concept and requires more time than we have. With the approval of combining a project of another class’s to this final project (approval received from both professors), the new project consists of a mobile application that is named ‘Trash-Talk’ which allows users to communicate just as if they were normally texting. This will showcase the user’s name, location and how many miles apart they are from one another. This is a project of another class of Ruiqis that we decided to combine as our final project.  We have almost finished this project. We have app.js, contentments files now. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

For the new project, we still need to edit how to update the distance between the two users based on current location for more accuracy.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We still have not figured out how to let the location update and calculate the distance once the user types something in the chat room.
