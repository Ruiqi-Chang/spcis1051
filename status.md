I plan to change the project. The new project title is Trash-Talk

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We did part of HTML Page, JS files and built a database, but not finished for the original project, because I find I may need to spend some money on a third-party API about the map or learn to use Leaflet.js package which is totally new concept.
For the new project, this is a project of my another class called Trash-Talk. This project is a mobile application. Our team almost finished this project.  We have app.js, contentments files now. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

For the new project, we still need to edit how to update the distance between the two users based on current location.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

We still have not figured out how to let the location update and calculate the distance once the user type something in the chat room.
