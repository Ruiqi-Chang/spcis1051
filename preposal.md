# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
Website that shows countries that lack education, primarily for women. The website will contain research, video clips, and charity/organization links that will lead the user to the donation site. The website may hold an interactive map (API) or something similar of sorts. Languages that we plan on using consist of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and possibly a bit of Python. 


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
Minu Patel section 004 

## Do you have any questions of your own?
What Temple domain can we use to publish our website? 
Do we have to connect the MySQL  database to our website?
